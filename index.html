        <h3 id="about">About Me</h3>
         <p>After studying Music Production in college, I felt I needed a change in direction.
            Once I did some research into different majors, I stumbled upon computer science
            and immediately it caught my interest.  It was a challenge stepping into unfamiliar territory, but seeing the possibilities 
            of what could be made further pushed me to pursuing this career.</p>
         <p>My other interests include music and basketball. These are two things I love to listen to/watch as well as make/play.</p>
